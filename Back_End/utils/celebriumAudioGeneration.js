// const text = `Hey there, future botanists! Ever wondered how plants eat? They don't go to the grocery store, that's for sure! They make their own food through a super cool process called photosynthesis.

// Think of plants as tiny chefs. They use sunlight as their energy source, like a solar-powered oven. They also need carbon dioxide, which is a gas we breathe out, and water, which they soak up through their roots.

// So, the plants take sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water, and mix them all together. What do they make? They create glucose, which is a type of sugar that's their food, and oxygen, which is what we breathe! It's like a magical recipe.

// Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth. Plants provide us with the oxygen we need to breathe and the food we eat. Pretty amazing, right? So next time you see a plant, remember it's busy making its own food and helping us too!
